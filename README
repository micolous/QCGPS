QCGPS
Michael Farrell <http://micolous.id.au/>

QCGPS is a Quartz Composer patch to allow you to connect to a classic (read: NOT JSON) GPSd, such as GPSdX, and use data from the GPS in your QC compositions.

At the moment, it's very buggy, and only supports connecting to a local GPSd.


TODO LIST:

- Fix connecting to remote servers.
- Fix buffering issues with some implementations of GPSd.
- Fix crash on connection failure.
